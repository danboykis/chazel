# chazel

Hazelcast bells and whistles under the Clojure belt

![](https://clojars.org/chazel/latest-version.svg)

## show me

```clojure
user=> (use 'chazel)
nil
```

let's start a 3 node cluster

```clojure
user=> (cluster-of 3)
Mar 26, 2015 1:46:43 PM com.hazelcast.cluster.ClusterService
INFO: [10.36.124.50]:5701 [dev] [3.4.1]

Members [3] {
    Member [10.36.124.50]:5701 this
    Member [10.36.124.50]:5702
    Member [10.36.124.50]:5703
}
(#<HazelcastInstanceProxy HazelcastInstance{name='_hzInstance_1_dev', node=Address[10.36.124.50]:5701}> #<HazelcastInstanceProxy HazelcastInstance{name='_hzInstance_2_dev', node=Address[10.36.124.50]:5702}> #<HazelcastInstanceProxy HazelcastInstance{name='_hzInstance_3_dev', node=Address[10.36.124.50]:5703}>)
```

create a map (or multimap, or queue, etc):

```clojure
user=> (def appl (hz-map :appl))
#'user/appl

user=> (type appl)
com.hazelcast.map.impl.proxy.MapProxyImpl
```

use the map:

```clojure
user=> (put! appl :apple 42)

user=> appl
{:apple 42}
```

some other cool things:

```clojure
user=> (def goog (hz-map :goog))
#'user/goog

user=> (put! goog :goog 42)

user=> (find-all-maps (hz-instance))
({:appl 42} 
 {:goog 42})
```

### Connecting as a client

```clojure
user=> (def c (client-instance {:group-password "dev-pass", 
                                :hosts ["127.0.0.1"], 
                                :retry-ms 5000, 
                                :retry-max 720000, 
                                :group-name "dev"}))
                                
INFO: connecting to:  {:group-password dev-pass, :hosts [127.0.0.1], :retry-ms 5000, :retry-max 720000, :group-name dev}

user=> c
#<HazelcastClientProxy com.hazelcast.client.impl.HazelcastClientInstanceImpl@42b215c8>
```

In case it could not connect, it would retry according to `:retry-ms` and `:retry-max` values:

```clojure
WARNING: Unable to get alive cluster connection, try in 5000 ms later, attempt 1 of 720000.
WARNING: Unable to get alive cluster connection, try in 5000 ms later, attempt 2 of 720000.
...
```
### Serialization

Serialization is a big deal when hazelcast nodes are distributed, or when you connect to a remote hazelcast cluster. 
chazel solves this problem by delegating it to an optional serializer.

To start off, chazel has a [transit](https://github.com/cognitect/transit-clj) seriailzer ready to go:

```clojure
user=> (require '[chazel.serializer :refer [transit-in transit-out]])
user=> (def m (hz-map "amzn"))

user=> (put! m "bids" {:opening [429 431 430 429] :nbbo [428 430 429 427]} transit-out)
#<byte[] [B@5d9d8664>
user=>
```
notice `transit-out`, it is an optional function to `put!` that will be applied to the value before the hazelcast `.put` is called. In this case a value will be serialized with transit.

```clojure
user=> (cget m "bids")
#<byte[] [B@638b6eec>
```

a default chazel's `cget` will return the value the way hazelcast has it stored: as a byte array. Similarly to `put!`, `cget` also takes in an optional function that is applied after the value is fetched from hazelcast:

```clojure
user=> (cget m "bids" transit-in)
{:opening [429 431 430 429], :nbbo [428 430 429 427]}

user=> (type (cget m "bids" transit-in))
clojure.lang.PersistentArrayMap
```

In case you need to use a different serializer, you can either send a pull request updating [chazel.serializer](https://github.com/tolitius/chazel/blob/master/src/chazel/serializer.clj), or by specifying your own "secret" serialize function in `put!` and `get`.
